Simple game "FizzBuzz"

FizzBuzz is a simple game. The rules of the game are as follows:

Players take turns counting from 1 to a specified number (commonly 100).
For each number, if the number is divisible by 3, the player says "Fizz" instead of the number.
If the number is divisible by 5, the player says "Buzz" instead of the number.
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, the player says "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
For example, if the specified number is 20, the player would say: 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz. 
FizzBuzz can be a fun game to play with friends or coworkers.
